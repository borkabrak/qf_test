                    <h1>Cats</h1>
                    <p>Man's most insidious predator whose origins are lost in the mists of
                    yore, though recent information indicates they've been siphoning our
                    heat for over 50,000 years.</p>

                    <article>
                        <h1>Bast</h1>
                        <p>
                        From the 3rd millennium BC, when Bast begins to appear in our
                        records, she is depicted as either a fierce lioness or a woman with
                        the head of a lioness. Images of Bast were created from a local
                        stone, named alabaster today.[citation needed] The lioness was the
                        fiercest hunter among the animals in Africa, hunting in
                        co-operative groups of related females.

                        Originally she was viewed as the protector goddess of Lower Egypt. As
                        protector, she was seen as defender of the pharaoh, and consequently of the
                        later chief male deity, Ra, who was also a solar deity, gaining her the titles
                        Lady of Flame and Eye of Ra.

                        Her role in the Egyptian pantheon became diminished as Sekhmet, a similar
                        lioness war deity, became more dominant in the unified culture of Lower and
                        Upper Egypt known as the Two Lands.[citation needed]

                        In the first millennium BC, when domesticated cats were popularly kept as pets,
                        during the 18th dynasty Bastet began to be represented as a woman with the head
                        of a cat and ultimately, by the 22nd dynasty emerged as the Egyptian
                        cat-goddess par excellence. In the Middle Kingdom, the domestic cat appeared
                        as Bast’s sacred animal and after the New Kingdom she was depicted as a woman
                        with the head of a cat or a lioness, carrying a sacred rattle and a box or
                        basket.

                        <h1>Garfield</h1>
                        Garfield is an orange, fuzzy, tabby cat born in the kitchen of an Italian
                        restaurant (later revealed in the television special Garfield: His 9 Lives to
                        be Mama Leoni's Italian Restaurant) and immediately ate all the pasta and
                        lasagna in sight, thus developing his love and obsession for lasagna and
                        pizza. Gags in the strips commonly deal with Garfield's obesity (in one
                        strip, Jon jokes, "I wouldn't say Garfield is fat, but the last time he got on
                        a Ferris wheel, the two guys on top starved to death"), and his disdain of
                        any form of exertion or work. He is known for saying "breathing is exercise".
                        In addition to being portrayed as lazy and fat, Garfield is also pessimistic,
                        sadistic, cynical, sarcastic, sardonic and a bit obnoxious. He enjoys
                        destroying things, mauling the mailman, tormenting Odie, kicking Odie off the
                        table; he also makes snide comments, usually about Jon's inability to get a
                        date (in one strip, when Jon bemoans the fact that no one will go out with him
                        on New Year's, Garfield replies, "Don't feel bad Jon. They wouldn't go out with
                        you even if it weren't New Year's"). Though Garfield can be very cynical, he
                        does have a soft side for his teddy bear, Pooky, food and sleep, but one
                        Christmas he says "they say I have to get up early, be nice to people, skip
                        breakfast...I wish it would never end." It has been wondered by many
                        readers if Garfield can actually be understood by the non animal characters
                        around him. Sometimes it seems like Jon can hear him. However, it is mentioned
                        in more than one strip that Jon cannot understand Garfield. June 19 is
                        celebrated within the strip as Garfield's birthday. The appearance in 1979
                        claimed it to be his first birthday, although in the first appearance of the
                        strip (June 19, 1978) he was portrayed as a fully-grown cat.

                    <p>Man's best friend, primarily because they're (usually) demonstrably
                    less intelligent than we are.  However, recent studies indicate that
                    this is mainly due to the lack of opposing thumbs.  We recommend naming
                    one 'Enzo'.
                    </p>

                    <article>
                        <h1>Enzo</h1>
                        The novel follows the story of Denny Swift, a race car driver and customer
                        representative in a high-end Seattle auto dealership, and his dog Enzo, who
                        believes in the Mongolian legend that a dog who is prepared will be
                        reincarnated in his next life as a human. Enzo sets out to prepare, with The
                        Seattle Times calling his journey "a struggle to hone his humanness, to make
                        sense of the good, the bad and the unthinkable."

                        Enzo spends his days watching and learning from television, gleaning what he
                        can about his owner's greatest passion, race car driving — and relating it to
                        life. Enzo eventually plays a key role in Denny's child-custody battle with his
                        in-laws, and distills his observations of the human condition in the mantra
                        "that which you manifest is before you."

                        <h1>K-9</h1>
                        K-9 Mark III first appeared in the character's spin-off series, K-9 and Company
                        in its 1981 pilot "A Girl's Best Friend". In this, the character is presented
                        to former companion of the Doctor's Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen);
                        together, the two embark on a number of adventures. Only the first of these is
                        depicted on screen; several are shown in comic book and audio play adaptations,
                        and others are alluded to by the television series. Mark III made a brief
                        appearance alongside Sarah Jane in the Doctor Who 20th anniversary
                        ninety-minute The Five Doctors (1983), before appearing properly and for the
                        final time in the revived series' episode "School Reunion" in 2006. By the time
                        of that story, Mark III has fallen into disrepair and eventually sacrifices
                        himself to stop a plot by the alien Krillitane and defeat their leader, Lucas
                        Finch (Anthony Head). In the episode's conclusion, the Doctor presents Sarah
                        Jane with a new K-9 to encourage her to continue investigating alien activity;
                        the Doctor "rebuilt" him after the Mark III's sacrifice, implying that he had
                        the same mind and memories as his predecessor while still being a "brand new
                        model".

                        <h1>Nemo</h1>

                        Finding Nemo is a 2003 American computer-animated comedy-drama adventure film
                        written and directed by Andrew Stanton, released by Walt Disney Pictures, and
                        the fifth film produced by Pixar Animation Studios. It tells the story of the
                        over-protective clownfish named Marlin (Albert Brooks) who, along with a regal
                        tang named Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), searches for his abducted son Nemo
                        (Alexander Gould) all the way to Sydney Harbour. Along the way, Marlin learns
                        to take risks and let Nemo take care of himself.

                        It is Pixar's first film to be released in cinemas in the northern hemisphere
                        summer. The film was re-released for the first time in 3D on September 14,
                        2012, and it was released on Blu-ray on December 4, 2012. A sequel, Finding

                        <h1>Jaws</h1>

                        Jaws is a 1975 American thriller film directed by Steven Spielberg and based
                        on Peter Benchley's novel of the same name. The prototypical summer
                        blockbuster, its release is regarded as a watershed moment in motion picture
                        history. In the story, a giant man-eating great white shark attacks beachgoers
                        on Amity Island, a fictional summer resort town, prompting the local police
                        chief to hunt it with the help of a marine biologist and a professional shark
                        hunter. The film stars Roy Scheider as police chief Martin Brody, Richard
                        Dreyfuss as oceanographer Matt Hooper, Robert Shaw as shark hunter Quint,
                        Murray Hamilton as the mayor of Amity Island, and Lorraine Gary as Brody's
                        wife, Ellen. The screenplay is credited to both Benchley, who wrote the first
                        drafts, and actor-writer Carl Gottlieb, who rewrote the script during principal
                        photography.
