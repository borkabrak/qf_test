        <h1>Cats</h1>
        <p>Man's most insidious predator whose origins are lost in the mists of
        yore, though recent information indicates they've been siphoning our
        heat for over 50,000 years.</p>

            <h1>Bast</h1>
            <p>
            From the 3rd millennium BC, when Bast begins to appear in our
            records, she is depicted as either a fierce lioness or a woman with
            the head of a lioness. Images of Bast were created from a local
            stone, named alabaster today.[citation needed] The lioness was the
            fiercest hunter among the animals in Africa, hunting in
            co-operative groups of related females.

            Originally she was viewed as the protector goddess of Lower Egypt. As
            protector, she was seen as defender of the pharaoh, and consequently of the
            later chief male deity, Ra, who was also a solar deity, gaining her the titles
            Lady of Flame and Eye of Ra.

            Her role in the Egyptian pantheon became diminished as Sekhmet, a similar
            lioness war deity, became more dominant in the unified culture of Lower and
            Upper Egypt known as the Two Lands.[citation needed]

            In the first millennium BC, when domesticated cats were popularly kept as pets,
            during the 18th dynasty Bastet began to be represented as a woman with the head
            of a cat and ultimately, by the 22nd dynasty emerged as the Egyptian
            cat-goddess par excellence. In the Middle Kingdom, the domestic cat appeared
            as Bast’s sacred animal and after the New Kingdom she was depicted as a woman
            with the head of a cat or a lioness, carrying a sacred rattle and a box or
            basket.

            <h1>Garfield</h1>
            Garfield is an orange, fuzzy, tabby cat born in the kitchen of an Italian
            restaurant (later revealed in the television special Garfield: His 9 Lives to
            be Mama Leoni's Italian Restaurant) and immediately ate all the pasta and
            lasagna in sight, thus developing his love and obsession for lasagna and
            pizza. Gags in the strips commonly deal with Garfield's obesity (in one
            strip, Jon jokes, "I wouldn't say Garfield is fat, but the last time he got on
            a Ferris wheel, the two guys on top starved to death"), and his disdain of
            any form of exertion or work. He is known for saying "breathing is exercise".
            In addition to being portrayed as lazy and fat, Garfield is also pessimistic,
            sadistic, cynical, sarcastic, sardonic and a bit obnoxious. He enjoys
            destroying things, mauling the mailman, tormenting Odie, kicking Odie off the
            table; he also makes snide comments, usually about Jon's inability to get a
            date (in one strip, when Jon bemoans the fact that no one will go out with him
            on New Year's, Garfield replies, "Don't feel bad Jon. They wouldn't go out with
            you even if it weren't New Year's"). Though Garfield can be very cynical, he
            does have a soft side for his teddy bear, Pooky, food and sleep, but one
            Christmas he says "they say I have to get up early, be nice to people, skip
            breakfast...I wish it would never end." It has been wondered by many
            readers if Garfield can actually be understood by the non animal characters
            around him. Sometimes it seems like Jon can hear him. However, it is mentioned
            in more than one strip that Jon cannot understand Garfield. June 19 is
            celebrated within the strip as Garfield's birthday. The appearance in 1979
            claimed it to be his first birthday, although in the first appearance of the
            strip (June 19, 1978) he was portrayed as a fully-grown cat.

        <h1>Dogs</h1>
        <p>Man's best friend, primarily because they're (usually) demonstrably
        less intelligent than we are.  However, recent studies indicate that
        this is mainly due to the lack of opposing thumbs.  We recommend naming
        one 'Enzo'.

            <h1>Enzo</h1>
            The novel follows the story of Denny Swift, a race car driver and customer
            representative in a high-end Seattle auto dealership, and his dog Enzo, who
            believes in the Mongolian legend that a dog who is prepared will be
            reincarnated in his next life as a human. Enzo sets out to prepare, with The
            Seattle Times calling his journey "a struggle to hone his humanness, to make
            sense of the good, the bad and the unthinkable."

            Enzo spends his days watching and learning from television, gleaning what he
            can about his owner's greatest passion, race car driving — and relating it to
            life. Enzo eventually plays a key role in Denny's child-custody battle with his
            in-laws, and distills his observations of the human condition in the mantra
            "that which you manifest is before you."

            <h1>K-9</h1>
            K-9 Mark III first appeared in the character's spin-off series, K-9 and Company
            in its 1981 pilot "A Girl's Best Friend". In this, the character is presented
            to former companion of the Doctor's Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen);
            together, the two embark on a number of adventures. Only the first of these is
            depicted on screen; several are shown in comic book and audio play adaptations,
            and others are alluded to by the television series. Mark III made a brief
            appearance alongside Sarah Jane in the Doctor Who 20th anniversary
            ninety-minute The Five Doctors (1983), before appearing properly and for the
            final time in the revived series' episode "School Reunion" in 2006. By the time
            of that story, Mark III has fallen into disrepair and eventually sacrifices
            himself to stop a plot by the alien Krillitane and defeat their leader, Lucas
            Finch (Anthony Head). In the episode's conclusion, the Doctor presents Sarah
            Jane with a new K-9 to encourage her to continue investigating alien activity;
            the Doctor "rebuilt" him after the Mark III's sacrifice, implying that he had
            the same mind and memories as his predecessor while still being a "brand new
            model".

        <h1>Fish</h1>
        <p>Pets for people who don't really want pets, fish drift alone in
        their bowls, insulated from contact with people by virtue both of a
        watery lair incompatible with human respiration, and a wall of glass
        that passes light alone and forever cannot be breached by the touch of
        a lover.  The perfect pet for psychopaths.</p>

            <h1>Nemo</h1>

            Finding Nemo is a 2003 American computer-animated comedy-drama adventure film
            written and directed by Andrew Stanton, released by Walt Disney Pictures, and
            the fifth film produced by Pixar Animation Studios. It tells the story of the
            over-protective clownfish named Marlin (Albert Brooks) who, along with a regal
            tang named Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), searches for his abducted son Nemo
            (Alexander Gould) all the way to Sydney Harbour. Along the way, Marlin learns
            to take risks and let Nemo take care of himself.

            It is Pixar's first film to be released in cinemas in the northern hemisphere
            summer. The film was re-released for the first time in 3D on September 14,
            2012, and it was released on Blu-ray on December 4, 2012. A sequel, Finding
            Dory, is in development, set to be released on June 17, 2016.

            The film received universal critical acclaim, won the Academy Award for Best
            Animated Feature, and was nominated in three more categories including Best
            Original Screenplay. It was the second highest-grossing film of 2003, earning a
            total of $936 million worldwide. Finding Nemo is the best-selling DVD of all
            time, with over 40 million copies sold as of 2006, and was the
            highest-grossing G-rated film of all time before Pixar's own Toy Story 3
            overtook it. It is the 23rd highest-grossing film of all time, as well as the
            3rd highest-grossing animated film. In 2008, the American Film Institute named
            it the 10th greatest animated film ever made during their Top 10. </article>

            <h1>Jaws</h1>

            Jaws is a 1975 American thriller film directed by Steven Spielberg and based
            on Peter Benchley's novel of the same name. The prototypical summer
            blockbuster, its release is regarded as a watershed moment in motion picture
            history. In the story, a giant man-eating great white shark attacks beachgoers
            on Amity Island, a fictional summer resort town, prompting the local police
            chief to hunt it with the help of a marine biologist and a professional shark
            hunter. The film stars Roy Scheider as police chief Martin Brody, Richard
            Dreyfuss as oceanographer Matt Hooper, Robert Shaw as shark hunter Quint,
            Murray Hamilton as the mayor of Amity Island, and Lorraine Gary as Brody's
            wife, Ellen. The screenplay is credited to both Benchley, who wrote the first
            drafts, and actor-writer Carl Gottlieb, who rewrote the script during principal
            photography.
