        <h1>Cats</h1>
        <p>Man's most insidious predator whose origins are lost in the mists of
        yore, though recent information indicates they've been siphoning our
        heat for over 50,000 years.</p>

        <h1>Dogs</h1>
        <p>Man's best friend, primarily because they're (usually) demonstrably
        less intelligent than we are.  However, recent studies indicate that
        this is mainly due to the lack of opposing thumbs.  We recommend naming
        one 'Enzo'.

        <h1>Fish</h1>
        <p>Pets for people who don't really want pets, fish drift alone in
        their bowls, insulated from contact with people by virtue both of a
        watery lair incompatible with human respiration, and a wall of glass
        that passes light alone and forever cannot be breached by the touch of
        a lover.  The perfect pet for psychopaths.</p>
